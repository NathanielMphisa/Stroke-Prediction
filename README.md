# Stroke Prediction with Deep Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of stroke in patients using a deep learning model. Early prediction of stroke is crucial for reducing casualties, and this project leverages healthcare data to achieve that.

## Problem Statement

Stroke is a leading cause of death globally. This project focuses on building a model that can predict stroke risk based on patient information.

## Task

The primary task is to develop a deep learning model to predict stroke.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `healthcare_stroke.csv`, which includes features such as:

* Gender
* Age
* Hypertension
* Heart Disease
* Marital Status
* Work Type
* Residence Type
* Average Glucose Level
* BMI
* Smoking Status

## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Keras
* Scikit-learn
* Plotly
* Matplotlib

## Key Features

* Data loading and preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical features
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model building and training (using Keras)
* Model evaluation

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas seaborn numpy tensorflow scikit-learn plotly matplotlib`).
3.  Place the `healthcare_stroke.csv` dataset in the appropriate directory.
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `Stroke Prediction.ipynb` to reproduce the results.
